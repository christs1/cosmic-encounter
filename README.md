## Completed Tasks

### 1. Start Turn Phase Implementation (April 6, 2023)

In this update, we've enhanced the game initialization and Start Turn phase with robust logic for:

- **Random Alien Assignment**: Each player is now assigned a unique alien from the available pool.

  - Uses a Set-based tracking system to ensure no duplicated aliens
  - Provides clear logging of alien assignments
  - Handles edge cases when there are more players than available aliens

- **Card Distribution**: Initial player hands are now properly distributed with fairness guarantees.

  - Cards are expanded based on their count property (e.g., a card with count:5 creates 5 separate instances)
  - Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm ensures truly random distribution
  - Logic handles situations with limited cards, ensuring fair distribution

- **First Player Selection**: Random selection of the starting player.

- **Improved Error Handling**: Better validation and error handling for data loading.
  - Validates JSON data structure
  - Provides clear error messages and logging
  - Falls back to default data when needed
- **Deck Management**: Added logic for reshuffling discard pile when deck is empty.

**Files Affected:**

- `/src/game/logic/setup.js` - Primary changes for alien assignment and card distribution
- `/src/game/state/initialState.js` - Updated TODO comments
- `/src/game/state/gameReducer.js` - Enhanced DRAW_CARD action with discard pile reshuffling

### 2. Debug Logging Enhancements (April 6, 2023)

Added comprehensive debugging logs throughout the codebase to facilitate easier troubleshooting:

- **Setup Process Visibility**:

  - Detailed alien loading information with names and IDs
  - Card distribution statistics by type
  - First few cards after shuffling to verify randomization

- **Game State Transitions**:

  - Phase transition logs to track game flow
  - Clear phase number changes (e.g., "Phase 1 â†’ 2")

- **UI Component Debugging**:
  - Enhanced alien data loading logs in the HUD component
  - Detailed information on alien properties and image paths

**Files Affected:**

- `/src/game/logic/setup.js` - Added detailed logging for game setup
- `/src/game/state/gameReducer.js` - Added phase transition logs
- `/src/components/HUD/HUD.jsx` - Added detailed alien data loading logs

### 3. Game Flow and UI Improvements (April 9, 2023)

Enhanced the game interface and flow with several key improvements:

- **On-Screen Console Display**:
  - Added a console output panel on the right side of the screen
  - Captures all console.log messages for easier debugging
  - Provides timestamped logs with automatic scrolling
- **Player Turn Rotation**:
  - Implemented automatic player turn switching after a full phase cycle
  - Player turns now advance when transitioning from Resolution phase back to Start phase
  - Added clear console logs showing player changes
- **Game Event Notifications**:
  - Added a notification system that displays important game events on screen
  - Shows phase transitions with clear, temporary messages
  - Highlights player turn changes with color-coded notifications
  - Provides feedback for game start and other significant events

**Files Affected:**

- `/src/App.jsx` - Added console display panel and notification system
- `/src/game/state/gameReducer.js` - Updated to support player turn rotation
- `/src/index.css` - Added animation styles for notifications

### 4. Visual Enhancement Implementation (April 9, 2023)

Completely upgraded the game's visual appearance with enhanced 3D graphics and effects:

- **Advanced Black Hole/Warp**:

  - Implemented a detailed black hole in the center with event horizon glow
  - Added polar jets/cones with dynamic animations
  - Created rotating accretion disks with shaders
  - Added dynamic lighting effects around the black hole

- **Visually Stunning Planets**:

  - Enhanced planets with cloud layers and atmospheric effects
  - Implemented texture mapping and realistic lighting
  - Added rotation effects for more dynamic scenes

- **Detailed Spaceships**:

  - Created detailed UFO models with glowing effects
  - Added orbital flight paths around planets
  - Implemented dynamic lighting and reflection

- **Immersive Environment**:

  - Created a beautiful starfield with thousands of stars
  - Added nebula background for a more cosmic feel
  - Implemented subtle grid effect for game plane reference

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Used shader-based rendering for efficient performance
  - Added fallback options when textures aren't available
  - Optimized lighting and effects for performance

**Files Affected:**

- Created `/src/components/utils/textureLoader.js` - For efficient texture loading
- Created custom shaders in `/src/shaders/` directory
- Created enhanced components in `/src/components/OverviewScene/`:
  - `EnhancedPlanet.jsx`
  - `EnhancedWarp.jsx`
  - `EnhancedSpaceship.jsx`
  - `EnhancedStarfield.jsx`
  - `EnhancedBackground.jsx`
- Updated `/src/components/OverviewScene/GameBoard.jsx` to use the enhanced components

### 5. Visual Bug Fixes (April 10, 2023)

Fixed several visual issues to improve the overall appearance of the game:

- **Planet Brightness Enhancement**:
  - Increased planet brightness by a factor of 3
  - Enhanced the glow effects for better visibility
  - Improved color mapping for more vibrant planet appearances
- **Black Hole Rendering Fix**:
  - Fixed a bug with the transparent black sphere around the black hole
  - Resolved z-fighting issues with improved shader settings
  - Fixed the issue where the black hole would improperly resize during camera zooming
- **Spaceship Display Issues**:
  - Fixed issues preventing ships from appearing in orbit around planets
  - Simplified orbital calculations for more reliable ship positioning
  - Improved ship colors and added emissive properties for better visibility
  - Added debugging information to help identify and resolve rendering issues

**Files Affected:**

- `/src/components/OverviewScene/EnhancedPlanet.jsx` - Increased brightness and enhanced materials
- `/src/components/OverviewScene/EnhancedWarp.jsx` - Fixed rendering issues with black hole shaders
- `/src/components/OverviewScene/EnhancedSpaceship.jsx` - Fixed ship visibility and orbital calculations
- `/src/components/OverviewScene/GameBoard.jsx` - Added debugging for ship positioning

## Game Architecture

Cosmic Encounter is implemented with React and follows a reducer-based state management pattern:

- Game state is centralized in a reducer
- Components respond to state changes passed as props
- Game phases control the flow of gameplay
- Alien powers can affect game rules at specific trigger points

## Next Steps

- Implement the Destiny phase logic
- Create UI components for player interactions
- Add animation and effects for game actions
